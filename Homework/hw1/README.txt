1)   I selected the doctype (html5 specification) mainly because i wanted 
  to keep the document simple but also on the cutting edge of web development.
  
2)   This doctype is fairly relaxed when typed in the prolog, its not as strict 
  as the xhtml prolog required to specify its document.

3)   I ended up using a ton of <div> tags because of the fact that with the <p> 
  tag i couldn't properly format the border styling from css. Also the div
  tag tends to be a bit more powerful in properly formatting the content on 
  my page. So to make the content more semantically correct and informative
  i provided each div with classes or id's to denote what each section will 
  contain.
  
4)  The hCard specification is simple for many people and computers to understand
  because of the way that the classes and id's are defined. Its easy for a person 
  to know that when the class street-address is used that the information contained
  relates to the street address of the document creator. It's just simple.

        in to html documents.

In general i used w3schools to check information about certain tags within 
        html5 and if they worked with multiple browsers.
